# Array-Class-Cpp

This Class helps in creating dynamic arrays, C++ STL's vector is almost same, but in vector, once full, the whole array is copied to another location, while in my Array class, you can just keep on adding elements, without thinking about already added elements. The only disadvantage is that using indices take O(log(index)) time complexity.
